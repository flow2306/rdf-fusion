RDF Fusion is an experimental columnar [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) engine.
It is based on [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/), an extensible query engine that
uses [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) as its in-memory data format.

This project aims to provide a platform for experimenting with SPARQL and domain-specific dialects.
By building on top of DataFusion, users can interact with other efforts within the Arrow and DataFusion community.
While currently RDF Fusion is still in an early stage, we hope that at some point RDF Fusion can be used as a
standalone SPARQL engine in production.

A primary goal of RDF Fusion is to preserve the strengths of DataFusion and make them available to the Semantic Web
community.
These strengths include:

- Extensibility: DataFusion features many extension points that we use to implement SPARQL.
  We expose these extension points to RDF Fusion users for experimenting with SPARQL and domain-specific dialects.
  In the future, we would like to provide further extension points that are tailored towards SPARQL.
- Performance: DataFusion features a vectorized execution engine that can leverage the capabilities of modern CPUs.
  We track RDF Fusion's performance on [CodSpeed](https://codspeed.io/tobixdev/rdf-fusion) and will provide comparisons
  to other query engines soon in a [separate repository](https://github.com/tobixdev/sparql-bencher/).
- Boring Architecture: DataFusion implements an "industry-proven" architecture for query planning and query execution.
  If logical plans and execution plans are familiar to you, you will feel right at home.
  There is no need to learn a fundamentally different architecture for working SPARQL.
  We refer to [DataFusion's documentation](https://datafusion.apache.org/contributor-guide/architecture.html) for this
  purpose.

## Getting Started

You can use `cargo` to interact with the codebase or use [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) to run the pre-defined
commands, also used for continuous integration builds.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tobixdev/graphfusion.git # Clone Repository
git submodule update --init # Initialize submodules
just test # Run tests 
```

### Using RDF Fusion's CLI

Use `cargo` to install the CLI.

```bash
cargo install rdf-fusion-cli
```

Once installed, you can use the CLI to run a SPARQL engine. See `rdf-fusion-cli --help` for more information.

### Using RDF Fusion in your Project

Documentation for using RDF Fusion from another Rust project can be found in the main crate's [README](./lib/rdf-fusion/README.md).
Examples of using RDF Fusion can be found in the [examples](./examples) directory.

## Comparison with Some Other SPARQL Engines

Considering RDF Fusion for a project of yours?
Great!
This section is intended to give you an idea if RDF Fusion is a good fit for your project.

We believe the combination of the following aspects makes RDF Fusion stand out from other open-source SPARQL engines:

- Integration with the larger Arrow and DataFusion communities
- Extensibility is a primary goal, both based on DataFusion's infrastructure and SPARQL-specific extension points
- A columnar query engine based on DataFusion
- If you come from Arrow / DataFusion, a query engine architecture that you're already familiar with :)

Here is a short comparison with other open-source SPARQL engines.

- [Apache Jena ARQ](https://jena.apache.org/) is a well-known SPARQL engine written in Java.
  It also has a rich set of extension points which have been leveraged in multiple research prototypes.
  Supporting a similar set of SPARQL extension points for columnar query execution is one goal of RDF Fusion.
  We believe that while Jena may remain the go-to platform for experimenting with SPARQL, RDF Fusion has aspects that
  Jena cannot easily provide. Most notably, the integration with the Arrow and DataFusion communities and a columnar
  execution model. We believe that similar arguments hold for other well-known SPARQL engines, such
  as [RDF4J](https://rdf4j.org/) and will thus not repeat them here.
- [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph) is a relatively new SPARQL engine written in Rust.
  It was a major inspiration for this project, as RDF Fusion started as a fork from it.
  Oxigraph uses a custom row-based query engine that has very low overhead and is thus fast for simple
  data retrieval queries.
  However, the extension system is not as extensive as DataFusion's approach, and RDF Fusion tends to perform better on
  queries that involve processing large amounts of data.
- [QLever](https://github.com/ad-freiburg/qlever) is a SPARQL engine written in C++ that is designed to perform well,
  especially on large datasets.
  It is based on a custom-built query engine tailored for SPARQL workloads.
  While their "from-scratch approach" certainly has benefits, it cannot easily interact with the Arrow and DataFusion
  ecosystem.
  Furthermore, RDF Fusion has a stronger focus on extensibility, especially if you want to interact with non-graph data
  in your queries.

## Missing Feature?

As mentioned above, RDF Fusion is still in an early stage.
We are missing essential features for a standalone SPARQL engine, such as persistent storage, RDF 1.2 support, a
graphical user interface, and many other features that have been developed in other engines over many years.
Even though Arrow and DataFusion helps us in building these features (A LOT!), this is still a non-trivial task that
requires sustained effort.
If you are looking to implement some of these features, please create or comment on
an [issue](https://github.com/tobixdev/rdf-fusion/issues) to get in touch with us.
We are more than happy to help you with your first steps and welcome all kinds of contributions!

## Project Structure

You can find the core implementation of RDF Fusion in the [rdf-fusion](./lib/rdf-fusion) crate.
The sub crates of this crate are explained in its documentation.

In addition to that, this repository also contains the following crates:

- [rdf-fusion-cli](./cli): A command line interface for using RDF Fusion.
- [rdf-fusion-bench](./bench): A program for executing benchmarks with RDF Fusion. Note that Criterion benchmarks are
  not also part of the other creations.
- [rdf-fusion-examples](./examples): A collection of examples for using RDF Fusion.
- [rdf-fusion-testsuite](./testsuite): An end-to-end test suite, including SPARQL conformance tests.

In addition to the Rust code, this repository also contains the following folders:

- [misc](./misc): Miscellaneous files, such as the changelog and license files of Oxigraph (see below).
- [justfile](./justfile) A justfile for running common commands (e.g., preparing benchmark data) with the goal of making
  it easier to run the project locally.

## Help

Feel free to use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/tobixdev/graphfusion/discussions) to ask questions or talk
about RdfFusion.
[Bug reports](https://github.com/tobixdev/graphfusion/issues) are also very welcome.

As this project started as a fork of [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph), it still contains some code
from Oxigraph. Oxigraph was originally licensed under Apache 2.0 OR MIT. This means that the Oxigraph portions of
the code can also be used under the MIT license, while all new contributions in this repository are provided only
under Apache 2.0.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version Policy

Our policy is to adopt the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of DataFusion.

## Acknowledgements

The project started as a fork from [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph), a graph database written in Rust
with a custom SPARQL query engine.
While large portions of the codebase have been written from scratch, there is still code from Oxigraph in this
repository.
