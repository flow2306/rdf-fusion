/// Specifies how blank nodes should be matched.
///
/// Blank nodes are scoped to a single graph. Users must choose whether a blank node in a pattern
/// should only match blank nodes with the same label in the graph or match any node (like a
/// variable).
///
/// In SPARQL queries, this strict matching is generally not desired because the blank nodes in the
/// query are different from the blank nodes in the graph (even if they have the same label!). In
/// this case, blank nodes in the query should be treated as variables and can therefore match any
/// node in the graph.
///
/// However, if the goal is to retrieve all quads with a specific blank node as the subject, it
/// may be appropriate to only match the blank node with that exact label in the graph.
///
/// Examples:
///
/// | Mode     | To Match | In Graph | Matches? |
/// |----------|----------|----------|----------|
/// | Variable | `_:a`    | `_:a`    | Yes      |
/// | Variable | `_:a`    | `_:b`    | Yes      |
/// | Filter   | `_:a`    | `_:a`    | Yes      |
/// | Filter   | `_:a`    | `_:b`    | No       |
