//! This crate provides an interface to the [RDF Fusion](../rdf-fusion) extension API, enabling the development of
//! extensions for the SPARQL engine.
//!
//! Currently, it allows you to implement:
//! - Custom SPARQL function registries
//! - Custom storage layers
//!
//! While we aim to maintain a stable API, the crate is still evolving, and therefore some APIs may change frequently.
//! If you are building custom extensions, we welcome your feedback on how to improve this crate and make extension
//! development easier.
