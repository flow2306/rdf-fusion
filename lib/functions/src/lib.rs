//! This crate implements the SPARQL scalar and aggregate functions for [RDF Fusion](../../rdf-fusion).
//!
//! While all SPARQL functions are implemented as DataFusion user-defined functions (UDFs),
//! we also provide additional support to simplify SPARQL function implementation.
//!
//! # Scalar Functions
//!
//! To implement a scalar function, implement the [`ScalarSparqlOp`](scalar::ScalarSparqlOp) trait.
//! Then, use the [`ScalarSparqlOpAdapter`](scalar::ScalarSparqlOpAdapter) to make the SPARQL operation
//! compatible with DataFusionâ€™s UDF system.
//!
//! # Aggregate Functions
//!
//! Aggregate functions currently have limited support.
//! They only support typed value encoding and do not yet provide a SPARQL-specific trait to simplify development.
//! We plan to provide enhanced support for aggregate functions in the future.
//!
//! # Dispatch
//!
//! Dispatch functions are a toolkit designed to help implement "iterative" versions of SPARQL functions
//! that operate on standard Rust types.
//! However, this functionality may be removed in the future for the following reasons:
//! 1. It often reduces performance compared to directly working on the arrays.
//! 2. In its current form, it is incompatible with some planned future improvements.
